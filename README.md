This project is under development. It is currently in a stable state. Development is active and ongoing, but this is not yet a finished firmware. If you'd like to build one to help find bugs and design issues, please do!

Loko is the tiniest GPS tracker what works with Lora radio and can connect to LoraWAN, Loko is designed to track the important instrument / vehicles like drones, expensive quipments, farm equipments etc. 

Loko can run +30 days in a single charge. Loko weights only 12 grams which makes it very suitable to add small devices as well. 

I used ready to use lora-e5 module from Seeed (https://www.seeedstudio.com/LoRa-E5-Wireless-Module-p-4745.html). which as very simple to use AT comands to speed up the development process. It speed up the ton of coding work.

LOKO is avaliable to purchase from NOLILAB:  BUY LOKO ([https://www.seeedstudio.com/Loko-GPS-Tracker-p-6261.html](http://nolilab.com))
